   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Poca
====

Poca is a fast, multithreaded and highly customizable command line podcast 
client, written in Python 3.

.. contents::
   :depth: 2

Features
--------


* **Maximum amount.** Specify how many episodes the subscription should get 
  before deleting old episodes to make room for new ones.
* **Override ID3/Vorbis metadata.** If you want *Savage Love* to have *Dan 
  Savage* in the artist field (rather than *The Stranger*\ ), poca will 
  automatically update the metadata upon download of each new episode. Or set
  genre to be overwritten by *Podcast* as a default.
* **Filter a feed.** Only want news reports in the morning or on Wednesdays? 
  Use criteria such as filename and title, or the hour, weekday or date of 
  publishing to filter what you want from a feed.
* **Rename files automatically.** Not all feeds have sensibly named media 
  files. Specify a renaming template like date_title to know what you're
  dealing with or to get alphabetical ordering to match chronology.
* **From the top.** A latecomer to *Serial* or other audiobook style podcasts?
  Specify ``from_the_top`` to get  oldest episodes first, rather 
  than the latest. To move on to later episodes simply delete old ones and 
  poca will fill up with the next in line.
* **Keeping track.** Poca logs downloads and removals to a local file so you
  easily see what's changed. Or configure it with an SMTP server and get
  notified when a feed stops working.
* **Manage your shows** by editing an easy-to-understand xml file. Or use
  the accompanying tool to add, delete, sort them, or get info about their
  publishing frequency, average episode length and more.

Poca also: has excellent unicode support for feeds, filenames and tags, gets 
cover images for feeds, has the ability to spoof user agents, can pause your
subscriptions, deals intelligently with interruptions, updates moved feeds
(HTTP 301) automatically, and more.

   :target: https://asciinema.org/a/OScSRCdsKGZLntYJ9K6LYSNMT
   :alt: asciicast


All configuration is done in a single XML-format file. For cron job 
compatibility, Poca has a quiet mode in addition to normal and verbose.

Installation
------------

You can install poca from `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poca>`_ using
pip. Be mindful that poca is python 3 so use ``pip3``\ :

.. code-block:: none

    pip3 install poca


If you are upgrading from any pre-1.0 release, please see this :doc:`Upgrade`. 
To remove Poca simply do:

.. code-block:: none

    pip3 uninstall poca


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 3.4 or later
- Third-party modules: ``requests`` ``feedparser`` ``lxml`` ``mutagen``
- Pip will automatically install any one of these found missing
- A unicode capable terminal is recommended

Configuration
-------------

The ``poca.xml`` file contains all poca's general and subscription specific 
configuration. To get started simply run ``poca`` once to get a basic config 
file placed in ``~/.poca``. 

The configuration file is divided into three main parts:

.. code-block:: xml

    <poca version="1.0">
      <settings>
      ...
      </settings>
      <defaults>
      ...
      </defaults>
      <subscriptions>
      ...
      </subscriptions>
    </poca>


* **Settings**: Contains general settings
* **Subscriptions**: Contains a list of all the podcasts you want to subscribe 
  to
* **Defaults**: Options in ``defaults`` are similar to those in 
  ``subscriptions``, only they apply globally (unless overridden).

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   Settings
   Subscriptions


Running
-------

Poca is run by issuing the ``poca`` command. Subscriptions can be managed 
by using the helper script ``poca-subscribe``.

Changelog
---------


Version `1.1 <https://github.com/brokkr/poca/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.1>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Features
""""""""

* Filenames: Auto-detect and fix filename collisions (e.g. if all files are named media.mp3)
* Metadata: Tagging now extends to mp4 files (as well as mp3 and files using vorbis comments for metadata)
* Metadata: Can now use 'comment' field to overwrite comments on ID3 tags (all existing comment frames are deleted) 
* Metadata: Empty values in metadata elements (e.g. ``<album></album>`` or ``<album/>``) can now be used remove the frame entirely. 
* Metadata: ``<chapters></chapters>`` is a special case of that. Adding the chapters element can be used to remove the table of contents and chapters frames (CTOC and CHAP). It will disregard any text value inserted. 

Fixes
"""""

* Filenames: Filesystem safe names. poca will automatically adapt the default or chosen filename to create legal filenames on the filesystem used for the podcast files (e.g. remove question marks from filenames on NTFS). It will not by default 'degrade' the filename more than needed for any given file system (see below). 
* Filenames: New setting to manually set filename permissiveness: Override the default behaviour by ordering poca to start at a lower level of filename character permissiveness.
* Config: File permissions check is more granular. Checks out as long as user has read permission to poca.xml and write permission to db and media folder. Note: A read-only config file prevents poca from updating the url if status == 301.
* Filters: Filename filtering has been fixed
* Filters: Filtering errors are now reported
* Download: Cover images are downloaded once, and only downloaded again if there is a new one, rather than with each update.
* Improved unicode support (better testing for support and fallbacks)
